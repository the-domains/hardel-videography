# What do we do, and how much does it cost?

Our main videography service is valued at $600, which gives you 1 videographer to cover your event for 3 hours and provide a 4-8 minute highlights video on a USB. This can be for any event!

And yes! We also do photography. Similar to videography, it is $600 for 1 photographer to cover your event for 3 hours -- we'll provide your digital photos on a USB and provide a small paper booklet with thumbnail previews of the photos.

There are more options we can provide (including album design) -- just send us a message!
