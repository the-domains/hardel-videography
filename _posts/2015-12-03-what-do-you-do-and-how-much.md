We know how important wedding days are -- but we also know that engagement parties, birthdays and many other events are important too. Some people have higher prices for weddings compared to other events -- we don't do that! We have one base price for all!

Our main videography service is valued at $600, which gives you 1 videographer to cover your event for 3 hours and provide a 4-8 minute highlights video on a USB. This can be for any event!

Need more coverage time? A second videographer? Let us know what you would like and we can tailor a price for you to best suit your needs.

And yes! We also do photography. Similar to videography, it is $600 for 1 photographer to cover your event for 3 hours -- we'll provide your digital photos on a USB and provide a small paper booklet with thumbnail previews of the photos.

There are more options we can provide (including album design and organise it to be printed) -- just send us a message!
