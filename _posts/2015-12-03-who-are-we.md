# Who are we?

Hardel Videography is a Sydney-based business specialising in capturing weddings and special events. Andrew and Harry both have a love for film, photography and seeing (and capturing) other people in love.

Andrew is the primary videographer and editor who is married to his wonderful wife, Jen. When Andrew isn't filming or photographing weddings or other events, you'll find him working full-time in a bookshop, at his church, making or drinking coffee, cooking or a mix of all of them together!

Harry is the second videographer at Hardel Videography. He works full-time as an electrical technician, is married to his wife, Jackie, and has three daughters (and a son-in-law).

**So what's different about what we do?**We don't use a lot of technical distracting gear and try to stay out of everyone's way (sometimes that's not really possible though). We take a very discreet approach throughout events we capture, creating a candid and natural video.

For your wedding, there are things you definitely don't want missed: the bride walking down the aisle, the vows, cutting the cake, speeches, your first dance. We believe these very big things are important, _but_ there are all the little things that make up your day which should never be missed! These "little" things are actually **big******things: the quick expressions of excitement and love that you show, the young and old people around you celebrating your day, the flowers, decorations and surroundings. The moments that are there for a short time and then gone as you head off down the road of marriage together. It's in the little moments we set ourselves apart from others -- to help you always remember your special day. The little moments that bring back memories of the events that unfolded -- not just for general nostalgia, but to trigger all your senses as you re-watch the whole of your day.

What we produce is something that you will remember actually happened naturally on your special day -- not a scripted production we get you to perform!
