# Dianne & Gary's Wedding - 17.January.2015

In January, we were asked to film a wedding. Andrew worked on his own that day, but when he arrived, he discovered there wasn't a photographer to cover the wedding. So, a decision was made to do something a little bit different... a little bit crazy -- he covered both the videography AND photography for the day.

It was a fantastic day, both Dianne and Gary organised their wedding beautifully. The sun was shining over Sydney harbour... everything was just wow! While it was a lot of hard work to organise both the photos and video, we're glad we did it. Here are some of the photos from the day:
